One big aspect for car enthusiasts who are building their own personal cars is keeping track of every part installed and when it was installed. Usually the system for tracking vehicle expenditures is using a good old-fashioned notebook or similar resource. A few expenditures that car enthusiasts keep track of are repairs and the costs associated, upgrades, the date installed, the price of the items installed, where the item was purchased, and other similar aspects. Tracking all these items is useful, to know the total amount invested in a certain vehicle as well as when it is time to replace or maintenance a specific item based off personal or manufacturer recommendations. The only app like this concept I have been using is the phone application, Car Care by CARFAX. This is a great application for tire rotations, emissions inspections, repairs, as well as vehicle registration. However, car enthusiasts tend to add modifications that are not common for their vehicle and like to keep track of receipts, where the item was purchased, warranties on those items, and other part information. Overall, this application will combine the best aspects of common vehicle maintenance as well as car enthusiast related upgrades that the user wishes to add. 

Each user of this application will have to create a user profile. This will be used to login and keep track of all their additions to their profiles. The user login will have these characteristics:
*	Username (Required)
*	Email (Required)
*	Password (Required)
*	First Name (Required)
*	Middle Initial (Optional)
*	Last Name (Required)
*	Location (Optional)
*	About Me (Optional)

After the user has created their profile, they then can individually add their vehicles to their profiles. Each vehicle will have the option to add the following information:
*	Make (Required)
* Model (Required)
*	Year (Required)
* Mileage (Required)
*	Vehicle Identification Number (Optional)
*	Nickname (Optional)
*	Photo (Optional)

Once they do so, they will be able to track their Oil changes, Tire information and service intervals, vehicle upgrades, as well as repairs. For the oil changes, the users will be able to track the oil and filter used, the capacity used, if they added stabilizer, cost, as well as at what vehicle mileage this was performed. If the user wishes to track their tires, they can track the brand, tire size, type of tire, where they purchased the tires, the mileage installed, and they may track tire rotations as well. 
As for the main application concept, upgrades and Repairs will have the same options to add to their specific vehicle.  However, repairs and upgrades will be their own two separated categories with sub categories to choose from based off of the location on the party type. These options include:
*	Part Category â€“ Will have a list of Categories for user to choose from (Required)
*	Part Type (Required)
*	Date Purchased (Optional)
*	Location Purchased (Optional)
*	Part Price (Optional)
* miscellaneous items cost (optional)
*	Mileage Installed (Optional)
*	Date Installed (Optional)
*	Location Installed (Optional)
*	Warranty Expiration Date (Optional)
*	Receipt Photo Upload (Optional)
*	Photos (Optional)

Overall, this application will be useful for car enthusiasts in a variety of ways, as well as for someone who wants to just keep up with regular maintenance. From basic oil changes to doing a complete motor swap, this application will suit everyone who cares about maintaining their investment and having the ability to know the total amount of money invested into their vehicles.
